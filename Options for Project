(most likely to choose) Google Books API https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using - used to create a list of recommendations when a user enters a book title and want something similar. 
The list will be formulated based on author, publication year, genre, and age rating. Use location to connect readers reading similar/the same books.

Build an app that allows users to post pictures of found/lost animals and shows users the posts within a certain range of location  (sort of like a dating app). 
Fit with messaging to allow users to reach out to each other.

Build an app for college students that can group/pair users for carpooling for their trips home based on location of where they are and where they need to go. 
There can be users who are offering to use their car but might not want to cover gas and that’s where the other person comes in. I could use it to allow people to limit who they are paired with base on age, gender, etc.
